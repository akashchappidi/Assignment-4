        "Q1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (oop) ?\n",
        "\n",
        "-->Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around \"objects\" that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). This approach promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of software.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2) What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "-->In OOP, a class is a blueprint that defines the characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects. It serves as a template for creating instances (objects) of that specific type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3) What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "--> n OOP, an object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with its own unique set of data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) defined by the class\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "--> Abstraction: Hides implementation details, focusing on essential behavior.\n",
        "Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods, controlling access to internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "--> Dunder methods in Python are special methods starting and ending with __ (e.g., __init__). They customize object behavior (e.g., operator overloading, built-in function interactions) and are invoked implicitly by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6)  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
        "--> that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of an existing class (superclass or base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "-->Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This enables code to work with objects of various classes uniformly, promoting flexibility and reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "--> Encapsulation in Python is achieved through access modifiers (single and double underscores). These conventions control the\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9) What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "--> In Python, a constructor is a special method named __init__ that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes with initial values or perform any necessary setup actions during object creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10)What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        "--> Class Methods: Defined using @classmethod decorator, bound to the class itself, accessed using ClassName.method_name().\n",
        "Static Methods: Defined using @staticmethod decorator, not bound to the class or instance, accessed using ClassName.method_name().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "--> Python doesn't directly support method overloading. Achieve similar behavior using default arguments, variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs), or consider alternative approaches like polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "--> Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation for a method inherited from its parent class, enabling customization of behavior while maintaining the same method signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "--> The @property decorator in Python lets you define methods that behave like attributes. This enhances encapsulation by controlling attribute access and modification, enabling features like data validation and computed properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "-->Polymorphism enhances code reusability and flexibility by enabling code to work with objects of different classes uniformly, making it easier to adapt to changes and reducing code redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "--> An abstract class in Python is a blueprint that cannot be instantiated directly. It defines a common interface and forces subclasses to implement specific methods, promoting a standardized structure and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "--> OOP offers modularity, reusability, flexibility, data encapsulation, and improved code organization. This leads to more efficient, maintainable, and scalable software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "--> Instance Variable: Unique to each object of a class, defined within methods (like __init__).\n",
        "Class Variable: Shared among all instances of a class, defined directly within the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes, increasing flexibility but potentially leading to complex relationships and the \"diamond problem.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19) Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "-->__str__ provides a user-friendly string representation of an object.\n",
        "__repr__ provides an unambiguous string representation for developers and debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20) What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "--> The super() function in Python allows you to call methods of the parent class within a child class, enabling method overriding and proper handling of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "--> The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that's called when an object is about to be garbage collected. Its primary purpose is to perform necessary cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing external resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "-->@staticmethod: No implicit self or cls; behaves like a regular function but defined within a class.\n",
        "@classmethod: Receives cls (the class) as the first argument; can access and modify class attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "-->In Python, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type (their parent class). This is achieved through method overriding, where child classes provide their own specific implementations of methods defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24)What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "--> Method chaining in Python allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single line. Each method returns the object itself, enabling subsequent method calls in a fluent and concise manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25)What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python.?\n",
        "--> he __call__ method in Python enables you to create callable objects. By defining this method within a class, you can treat instances of that class as functions, allowing you to call them directly.\n",
